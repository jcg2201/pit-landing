                  A progressive web application that is designed to decentralize</span> the prevalence of English as the default language for most website development. Given a large population of the Queen’s Public Library (OPL) patrons do not speak English very well and are often bilingual or multilingual, Multi-log treats all languages equally by curating content based on the user's language preference. The goal is to ensure the user experience for all is maintained regardless of the user’s known language, enabling non-English speakers (especially immigrants) to fully utilize QPL’s services.

            Queens Borough in New York City has been celebrated as the most linguistically diverse place on Earth.

            Interviews with first and second generation immigrants helped identify language barriers they faced while entering the country. Joseph, a first generation immigrant, acted as a translator for his parents when they first moved over. Despite not knowing English himself, there is a crucial demand for him to pick up the language in a short period of time. Below is a collection of  personas we developed through a summary from speaking to second generation immigrants, coupled with user journeys that illustrate a common pain point for them.

            Upon talking to Nick Buron, the Chief Librarian, and Denise Corcoran, Director of Central Library Services, we realize the QPL do not identify themselves as a city agency, but do share close ties with the city departments. In terms of translation services, the library has pioneered the adoption of using Travis translation devices and subscription to the Language Line as main programs to tackle the language barrier to communicate and support their non-English speaking patrons before LL30 or EE120 was issued. With our base assumptions being proven wrong, the team went back to the drafting board to shift our design focus, looking at ways to better promote and improve upon QPL programs and services offered for the immigrant community.

            For 1st generations they don’t see a reason for them to seek help from libraries and libraries are not perceived as destinations for social engagement and knowledge enrichment. This HMW question aims to establish connections with cultural institutions, or other community groups to offer events and programs that will be of interest to the older generation. In response, the team compared existing programs that the library may cater towards the older generation.

            We know from interviews with librarians that QPL have a series of language services that are free to the public: Language Line (available for 70+ languages), Travis translation devices in every library, and free English classes. Yet, second generation immigrants do seek libraries for help when they need it most. Can we improve the ways libraries reach to younger patrons? Competitive analysis of existing outreach efforts helped us see what methods are effective.

            QPL librarians are trained to be familiar with library services, but do not use reliable translation services (that are sometimes available in the library) and use what is most convenient and fast. The team produced a list of translation services that is offered by the library and other organizations to understand the options available to librarians when they communicate with patrons.

        Although user testing and community engagement are already essential part of the usual Double Diamond design process, the team believes Public Interest Technologies require a more comprehensive research phase. Identifying and talking to the right people helped guide our design process and the scope of our project. When we began, the team focused on language policies and it’s gap in implementation in city agencies. However, after talking to Nick and Denise we soon realized that our assumptions and understanding of how the QPL system situates itself and operates within the larger context. 
       </p>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">
        Communication with QPL representatives and librarians was also crucial not only in the research and design phase. The team faced technical difficulties integrating data from QPL as we were not able to convey the type of data or format we needed. To this point, the team reflects that external and internal communication should be improved on. 
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">
        A challenge the team faced was conducting enough user tests on different types of users since the prototypes are only developed in specific languages (Chinese or Spanish) as a result of the limitation of our team’s language skills.

        The development of our project would not be possible without the support and guidance of our faculty Lydia Chilton (School of Engineering, Computer Science). Mark Hansen (School of Journalism). Laura Kurgan (Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation), Celeste Layne, Anne-Laure Razat and Stacy Tao.

        We really appreciate the help from Nick Buron, the Chief Librarian of QPL, Denise Corcoran, Director of Central Library Services, Fred J. Gitner, Assistant Director of New Initiatives and Partnership Liaison, and the numerous branch librarians who provided us information and data that we need to develop the project.      </p>
